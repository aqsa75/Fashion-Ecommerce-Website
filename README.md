Visually appealing home page with featured products and promotions.
Comprehensive shop page for browsing and filtering products.
Detailed product pages with images, descriptions, pricing, and size/color options.
Interactive shopping cart for adding/removing items and adjusting quantities.
Responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.
Dedicated contact page for customer inquiries and feedback.
Blog page featuring articles on modest fashion trailblazers.
